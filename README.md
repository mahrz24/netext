# netext

Netext is a library to render (networkx) graphs to the the terminal using rich. For the layout it uses the grandalf layout library but other layout engines can be used and will be added in the future.

The library is at an early prototyping / alpha stage and is not yet on PyPi. Everything can break and tests are not extensive (yet). Use at your own risk.
