# Release pipeline

- [ ] Add tests for new features and the rust code
- [ ] Organize imports
- [ ] Add maturin to build part of the CI
- [ ] Update documentation
- [ ] Make release pipeline
- [ ] Add benchmarks

# Past release

- [ ] Strict typechecking
- [ ] Add benchmark comparison to PRs
- [ ] Sugiyama better alignment of nodes
- [ ] Waypoints for even faster A*
- [ ] Better default choice of magnets / slots for connections
- [ ] Open up the routing config to the user if they want to
- [ ] Other shapes
- [ ] Overlay edges in rendering
- [ ] Tree layout
- [ ] Git Branch layout
- [ ] Improve edge routing:
    - Crossing corners should be avoided (cost term) (unless sharing node)
    - Crossling lines for more then 1 unit should be avoided (additional penalty) (unless sharing node)
    - Prefer distance to node
