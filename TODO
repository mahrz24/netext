# Routing Improvements
- [ ] Add a cost term for distance to node
- [ ] Add a cost term for distance to edge
- [ ] Add a cost term for crossing corners
- [ ] Multiple intermediate points based on directions
- [ ] When using the same line style, connect to the closest point on existing edge
- [ ] T-junctions when renderin line buffers with different styles
- [ ] Reduce costs on very dense graph automatically

# Past release

- [ ] Add benchmarks
- [ ] Add tests for the rust library as well
- [ ] Strict typechecking
- [ ] Add benchmark comparison to PRs
- [ ] Sugiyama better alignment of nodes
- [ ] Open up the routing config to the user if they want to
- [ ] Other shapes
- [ ] Overlay edges in rendering
- [ ] Tree layout
- [ ] Git Branch layout
- [ ] Remove networkx dependency

- [ ] Improve edge routing:
    - Crossing corners should be avoided (cost term) (unless sharing node)
    - Crossling lines for more then 1 unit should be avoided (additional penalty) (unless sharing node)
    - Prefer distance to node
